# Programming-Fundamentals
 Fundamental concepts in programming, which are the basis for effective and quality training in the professional modules. Compared to Programming Basics, I have used more complex programming concepts and structures such as: arrays, sheets, citizen objects and classes. I have studied additional technologies that every software developer needs, such as HTML and CSS, HTTP, bit operations, and more. I started the training on the 16th of May and successfully completed it on the 7th of August.

Skills I have acquired:
 - handling the standard functionality of the programming language
 - basics of web development
 - understanding the interrelationship between different IT concepts
 - analysis of complex problems and reduction to computer-executable steps
 - basic HTML and CSS skills
 - working with linear data structures
